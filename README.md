## Branches

Flare follows a branching strategy to manage code changes and releases effectively:

- **main**: The `main` branch contains production-ready code. This branch always reflects the latest stable release.
- **dev**: The `dev` branch serves as the integration branch for ongoing development work. Feature branches are merged into `dev` once they are stable.
- **feature branches**: Individual features or fixes are developed in separate branches (e.g., `feature/login-system`, `fix/database-connection`). Once a feature is complete and tested, it is merged into `dev`.
- **release branches**: When preparing for a new release, a release branch may be created from `dev`. This branch is used to finalize the release and address any last-minute issues before merging into `main`.
- **hotfix branches**: In the event of critical bugs or issues in the production environment, a hotfix branch may be created from `main`. Once the hotfix is applied and tested, it is merged into both `main` and `dev`.
